  <section> <!-- introduction -->
    <p><span>jot &</span> combines file storage and organization with a simple notepad. Notes offer a quick and easy way for people to share and collaborate.</p>

        <h2>The problem</h2>

        <h2>The solution</h2>
      </header>

      <p>This is a concept for a responsive web app integrating storage and sharing services with a collaborative notepad. It empowers users to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Save files and create a structure for them</li>
        <li>Create and collaborate in notes</li>
        <li>Share directly to social networks, as well as through links and email</li>
        <li>Manipulate images simply (i.e. moving, resizing, cropping, and captioning)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Working from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_fPbDX6tGxTq1HszAyMTy-HK2dYhrVz_UCDcedSyVRo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">a broad brief</a> proposing a new cloud storage service, I asked basic questions to gain definition:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What do people need from a cloud storage service?</li>
        <li>What aren’t they getting from current services?</li>
        <li>What is an MVP which fits that niche and satisfies those needs?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I set out to answer these questions through competitive analysis and user surveys.</p>

        </p>
      </header>

      <p>By examining the apps and landing pages for these services and reading several industry analyses, I learned a strong competitor should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish a clear brand identity, especially on the landing page</li>
        <li>Minimize distractions, letting focus on their content</li>
        <li>Closely integrate storage, photos, and writing</li>
        <li>Place few limits on sharing and collaboration</li>
        <li>Offer a similar level of experience across devices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All services supported saving, sharing, text-editing, and some form of collaboration, with support across devices. These broad areas of overlap were taken as the start of an MVP.</p>

      </header>

      <p>I surveyed 57 people on their use of cloud storage services, leading to these <em>key goals</em> for a new app:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve image sharing and organization</li>

          <h3>Phil</h3>
          <p>retail manager and photo enthusiast</p>
        </header>

        <img src="images/jotAnd/personaPhil.jpg" alt="Phil and his Nikon camera" class="personaPhoto">

        <h4>Motivations:</h4>
        <p>Phil uses Dropbox, Google Drive, and Google Photos for free, and pays for iCloud. Images take up most of his storage. He would like one service with a large amount of space for saving and sharing photos (by themselves and grouped together) alongside comments.</p>

        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <p>Phil wants to post directly to social networks or link others to a page with equal ease. He needs to be able to document incidents, combining photos and writing, and to collaborate on these reports with the rest of his team.</p>

        <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
        <p>Phil wishes his uploads were faster. He doesn’t like pop-over messages suggesting he upgrade service. He doesn’t want to use email to discuss photos he’s shared.</p>

        <img src="images/jotAnd/personaAdrienne.png" alt="Adrienne standing outside at night" class="personaPhoto">

        <h4>Motivations:</h4>
        <p>Adrienne uses Google Drive for most of her work needs and Dropbox for extra storage. She creates and works on images, written documents, and forms across various apps. She spends more time than she would like trying to organize files and folders.</p>

        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <p>Adrienne wants to be able to quickly and easily find, organize, and share files (especially images) in online storage.</p>

        <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
        <p>Adrienne wishes photo sorting and sharing was more enjoyable. She doesn’t like the amount of time it can take to find a particular picture. She also thinks the Google Drive interface is a bit opaque.</p>

        <img src="images/jotAnd/personaJean.png" alt="Jean smiling in sunglasses" class="personaPhoto">

        <h4>Motivations:</h4>
        <p>Jean uses Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive with free accounts. He shares files directly and across social networks, including Behance, Tumblr, and Pinterest. Before reaching a finished product, Jean may send clients moodboards, storyboards, and iterative sketches with notes. He keeps his projects organized.</p>

        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <p>Jean would like a single service from which to share and organize files. He needs to be able to attach notes to illustrations (without distracting from them) and to let clients respond or change files in real time.</p>

        <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
        <p>Jean doesn’t like available mobile apps and finds them difficult to manage. He is unsatisfied with the current file layouts and organization; he would like more visual and structured options.</p>

      <p>Following the user stories, I generated 33 user flows, an important reference for crafting content strategy and connecting wireframes.</p>

      </header>

      <p>Drawing logical connections between tasks in the user flows, I drew up a site map, and began to verbally lay out the app and landing page.</p>

      <p>To establish the project's tone, I sketched some dummy wireframes, logos, and word association lists. I tried out several names, settling on the flexibility and promise of 'jot &'.</p>

      <p>These artefacts became the skeleton of my wireframes.</p>

      </header>

      <p>I began sketching wireframes at a fairly high level (showing basic ideas for forms, icons, pages, and menus) before transitioning to dummying pages in Figma.</p>

      <p>As I began to build out wireframes, the project ballooned with the creation of dozens of eventually discarded pages. Exact steps in processes turned out to be hard to pin down, and as I made changes in one place, it became difficult to maintain consistency.</p>

      <p>This taught me to start with atomic components before building out pages. I should have paid more attention to the smaller details first, built repeatable pieces, and then moved on to full screens and higher level processes.</p>

      <section> <!-- prototype -->

          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I worked out many of the problems in the static screens, and began to compose a clickable prototype. This turned out to be one of the hardest and most demanding sections of my work. I ended up making hundreds of pages of material while running into previously unknown constraints in Figma.</p>

        <p>I eventually dropped many responses to user input (such as hover states in menus), and leaving the prototype less interactive than planned in order to achieve functionality. This also meant losing hover-over-text which told users what clickable icons did.</p>

        <p>I continued to replace individual pieces with components and struggled to standardize my screens.</p>

        <p>I also started with a large set of screens for my desktop version (1440px width), and had to work backwards to make each desktop page responsive and to size things down for mobile screens.</p>

        <p>The order was backwards here. In the future, I intend to start with the smallest breakpoints (beginning in mobile) and to build from there.</p>

        <p>In this test, users were asked to look at a wireframe prototype of the jot & landing page and then:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Sign up for the app and take its tour</li>
          <li>Upload a folder, and create and name another folder</li>
          <li>Delete one file, and move a folder</li>
          <li>Open a note, in which they:</li>

            <li>Upload, resize, and caption a photo</li>

            <p>36 y.o., female, Product Manager</p>
            <p>in person</p>
          </header>

          <p>Alex learned how the system worked, successfully completing each task, and was able to apply the same approach to similar tasks, but was not always satisfied with the methods. She didn’t seem to enjoy the experience much; this might have been general discomfort with testing, but it was not helped in moments where she wasn’t sure how to accomplish tasks. In particular, the overflow menu was problematic and the ‘new’/plus menu was not immediately obvious to her.</p>
        </section> <!-- end tester 1, Alex -->

        <section> <!-- tester 2, Emma -->
          <header>

            <p>65 y.o., female, Social Worker</p>
            <p>video conference</p>
          </header>

          <p>Emma had no comments or questions regarding the app. There were a number of pain points which left her unsure and made it difficult to move confidently through jot &. Without a ‘next’ button on tour pages, she wasn’t sure how to proceed. The connection between ‘upload’ and saving a file to the cloud was unclear to her, so uploading files took her a little while. Using the overflow menu to delete or move objects was not obvious to her–she wanted to click on items and have the relevant options appear. Similar issues persisted in the notepad. The program was basically broken for her.</p>
        </section> <!-- end tester 2, Emma -->

        <section> <!-- tester 3, Ken -->
          <header>

            <p>video conference</p>
          </header>

          <p>Ken wanted a more explicitly guided experience, with clearer actions. He had similar issues to Alex and Emma above.</p>

            <h3>Resultant action</h3>
          </header>

          <p>The testers were able to navigate the landing page and sign up easily. However, the onboarding tour and empty state screen posed problems. Alleviating fear was the most important thing I had to do after testing.</p>

          <p>Improved tour directions and the addition of buttons to advance the tour let users ease in to the experience.</p>

          <p>Although I had assumed older users would be more comfortable using a traditional drop-down menu system, this was not true. Instead, all testers found the overflow menu confusing. They wanted the actions which affected an item to be accessed by pressing the item itself, not in the overflow menu. I followed their guidance. This helped diminish user fear and streamlined the process of acting on files and folders.</p>

          <p>Testers wanted more of an indication of when they were in a note and where the note workspace was. So I emboldened the bread crumbs and added a transition animation between storage and notes before moving on to visual design.</p>

      <p>Based on the needs of our personas and users in general, jot &amp's primary values are creativity, communication, and dependability. Its promotional copy seeks a sense of togetherness, sharing, memories, fun, and ease, while leaving room for business and work. There is also a quiet emphasis on personal empowerment, as well as ‘saving’, since people want to save space on their devices by saving items to the cloud while saving money.</p>

      <p>The brand color, a bright violet, mixes of work and play. The brand copy of Poppins sets a jaunty, bold feel, while Open Sans assures professionalism and reliability as a  body copy. The logo brings all of this together in a playful, geometric combination of the brand name, a camera, and a stylus.</p>

      <p>With the branding set, I began to apply it to create a mockup from my wireframes in Figma.</p>

      <p>First, I found free images which matched the brand, illustrated them in Autodesk Sketchbook (iOS), simplified the images in Adobe Illustrator, and added them to the landing and features pages.</p>

      <p>Throughout the mockup, I simplified pages, reset type, and added color while increasing consistency and whitespace. My intent was to create a more straightforward experience.</p>

        </header>

        <p>While working on my mockup, I was also building out connections between pages and components for the Figma prototype. I tested its features during this process when I made changes, and again before starting user testing. There weren’t any big surprises this time, just minor bugs.

          <p>David took his time moving through the app, reading carefully and considering things before moving on. He enjoyed the visuals, layouts, and copy in the landing and feature pages.</p>

          <p>In app, David enjoyed the presentation and “content flow” of text, color, and layout. He said, “It was great until using the menu. Then I felt like I needed a step-by-step guide….I like the whole concept of jot &amp.” He was able to move, delete, and restore items easily, but found uploading difficult.</p>

          <p>Devin found the logo and name slightly confusing at first, before reading the description. He liked the colors of the landing page, which he skimmed quickly. On the Features page, he was confused by the app example images in the hero section. Otherwise, he thought the information in these two pages was straightforward, understandable, and laid out well.</p>

          <p>Devin breezed through onboarding and the tour of jot & quickly, with few questions. He was able to move through the app at a brisk pace, only pausing briefly to try to figure out how to upload items. Devin described the app as functional, sensible, and user-friendly. He liked its art, colors, and layout. He said he would use the app and share it with others.</p>

          <p>Wesley was interested in the landing page. His first thought about the logo was it looked “like a camera”, but at second glance, it also struck him as a clipboard.</p>

          <p>He didn’t like the spacing of the feature’s page hero image, but was engaged by the rest.</p>

          <p>He went through the signup and tour processes quickly without any questions. He thought the pages were useful.</p>

          <p>Wesley said the prototype felt “relaxed and calm” but also “a little sad” because the app section was so overwhelmingly gray. He suggested adding different colors for file icons, with the color changing based upon the type of file. He was able to move through the app fairly quickly.</p>

          </header>

          <p>Due to responses to the Feature page’s hero images, I ran preference tests to see if a more open layout would be better received.</p>

          <p>While the users appreciated the colors of the feature and landing pages, they were less enthusiastic about the relative lack of color in the app. I subsequently ran preference tests to see if pages could be livened up without causing distraction.</p>

          <p>I adjusted the tour, simplifying micro-copy and reordering screens to give the tour a better flow. I added ‘back’ buttons, in case someone wanted to reread a section or accidentally moved forward. Boxes were rendered white instead of gray to add to readability and user comprehension. I also made arrows more obvious.</p>

          <p>We discovered several bugs in the prototype during testing, such as images not responding to input properly or pages mistakenly loading as overlays. These were fixed afterwards.</p>

        <p>I ran four preference tests, leading to a cleaner and more colorful dashboard and a more intuitive layout for the hero images on the features page.</p>

          <h3>Finishing touches</h3>
        </header>

        <p>In the mockups, I moved ‘sign out’ from the header to the nav bar, underneath ‘trash’, to help keep the user from accidentally signing out and to be consistent with the idea of navigation. I also increased internal consistency in spacing and alignment.</p>

        <p>For the prototype, I made the logo clickable, added a page for search results and adjusted some related overlays, and fixed a glitch which had some menu options being selected by hovering on them.</p>

        <p>In the styleguide, I matched the colors to all those used in the app, adding pages for the colors of file icons and buttons. I also put in a section covering the hover and click states of clickable icons and links.</p>

        <h2>The future of <span>jot &amp</span></h2>
      </header>

      <p>This is a complete MVP, which could be coded, tested, and delivered as a desktop web app. There is room for improvement, and more testing could done. In particular, the mobile version should go through user testing and be reiterated on.</p>

      <p>I would also like to see A/B tests for placement of the ‘new’-plus button, to see if it might be more effective in the navbar than at the upper right of the page.</p>

      <p>Future features might include automatically formatting photo collections and folders in automated notes, and a second, enlarged grid view with previews of items. Administrative tools should be considered for a second release to expand the user-base by addressing business and team use-cases.</p>

      <p>Finally, a microblog-style feed showing publicly shared notes might add further interactive and social elements, increasing user engagement.</p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
      </header>

      <p>After working my way through problems caused by not having built components or a pattern library early on, I realized I should focus on atomic elements first and build outwards. High-level sketches are useful starting points, but it’s important to sweat the details early on, even though they will undergo multiple iterations.</p>

      <p>In testing my wireframe prototype, I was surprised to find a uniform desire to interact with items instead of menus. I had assumed older people would be more used to a slightly more manual approach, but even those who had little or no experience with touch interfaces still intuitively wanted to click on items when asked to delete them, for example. This lead me to drop several options from the ellipsis menu, and focus on making items more interactive.</p>

      <p>I also learned the challenges of working without project management standards in place. This took longer and was more difficult than it could have been with greater structure in processes and approach, as in agile–a practice I found helpful in building this site.</p>
