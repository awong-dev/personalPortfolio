    <h1>I'm Tavis,</h1>
</header>

  <p>and I love storytelling and making a difference in people’s lives. I blend my unique backgrounds in art, retail, and social services with my technical skills in content, development, and design to help make things that help people.</p>

  <p>From my lifelong passion for illustration in daily life to my work as a writing consultant in child advocacy cases, I have seen that the right synthesis of form and function can help us solve problems, help people, and make the world a more interesting place.</p>

  <p>If you have big ideas for how you want your organization to interact with people online, especially if that would help people in need, I would love to talk with you about how that could happen. If you want to connect and share stories and experiences, I’ll gratefully listen.</p>
