              <h2>The solution</h2>
            </header>

            <p>This is a concept for a responsive web app integrating storage and sharing services with a collaborative notepad. It empowers users to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Save files and create a structure for them</li>
              <li>Create and collaborate in notes</li>
              <li>Share directly to social networks, as well as through links and email</li>
              <li>Manipulate images simply (i.e. moving, resizing, cropping, and captioning)</li>
            </ul>

            </header>

            <p>Working from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_fPbDX6tGxTq1HszAyMTy-HK2dYhrVz_UCDcedSyVRo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">a broad brief</a> proposing a new cloud storage service, I asked basic questions to gain definition:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>What do people need from a cloud storage service?</li>
              <li>What aren’t they getting from current services?</li>
              <li>What is an MVP which fits that niche and satisfies those needs?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I set out to answer these questions through competitive analysis and user surveys.</p>

          <section> <!-- competitive analysis -->

              </p>
            </header>

            <p>By examining the apps and landing pages for these services and reading several industry analyses, I learned a strong competitor should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Establish a clear brand identity, especially on the landing page</li>
              <li>Minimize distractions, letting focus on their content</li>
              <li>Closely integrate storage, photos, and writing</li>
              <li>Place few limits on sharing and collaboration</li>
              <li>Offer a similar level of experience across devices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All services supported saving, sharing, text-editing, and some form of collaboration, with support across devices. These broad areas of overlap were taken as the start of an MVP.</p>

              <li>Improve image sharing and organization</li>

              <img src="images/jotAnd/personaPhil.jpg" alt="Phil and his Nikon camera" class="personaPhoto">

              <h4>Motivations:</h4>
              <p>Phil uses Dropbox, Google Drive, and Google Photos for free, and pays for iCloud. Images take up most of his storage. He would like one service with a large amount of space for saving and sharing photos (by themselves and grouped together) alongside comments.</p>

              <h4>Goals:</h4>
              <p>Phil wants to post directly to social networks or link others to a page with equal ease. He needs to be able to document incidents, combining photos and writing, and to collaborate on these reports with the rest of his team.</p>

              <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
              <p>Phil wishes his uploads were faster. He doesn’t like pop-over messages suggesting he upgrade service. He doesn’t want to use email to discuss photos he’s shared.</p>

              <h4>Motivations:</h4>
              <p>Adrienne uses Google Drive for most of her work needs and Dropbox for extra storage. She creates and works on images, written documents, and forms across various apps. She spends more time than she would like trying to organize files and folders.</p>

              <h4>Goals:</h4>
              <p>Adrienne wants to be able to quickly and easily find, organize, and share files (especially images) in online storage.</p>

              <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
              <p>Adrienne wishes photo sorting and sharing was more enjoyable. She doesn’t like the amount of time it can take to find a particular picture. She also thinks the Google Drive interface is a bit opaque.</p>

              <p>Jean uses Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive with free accounts. He shares files directly and across social networks, including Behance, Tumblr, and Pinterest. Before reaching a finished product, Jean may send clients moodboards, storyboards, and iterative sketches with notes. He keeps his projects organized.</p>

              <h4>Goals:</h4>
              <p>Jean would like a single service from which to share and organize files. He needs to be able to attach notes to illustrations (without distracting from them) and to let clients respond or change files in real time.</p>

              <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
              <p>Jean doesn’t like available mobile apps and finds them difficult to manage. He is unsatisfied with the current file layouts and organization; he would like more visual and structured options.</p>

            <p>Referring to the surveys and personas, I made user stories for potential, new, returning, and administrative users. High priority tasks became the basis for acceptance of the MVP. Medium priority tasks were rendered nice-to-haves. Low priorities were ignored.</p>

            <p>Administrator tasks were not included in the MVP, but should be considered for future development.</p>

            <p>Drawing logical connections between tasks in the user flows, I drew up a site map, and began to verbally lay out the app and landing page.</p>

            <p>To establish the project's tone, I sketched some dummy wireframes, logos, and word association lists. I tried out several names, settling on the flexibility and promise of 'jot &'.</p>

            <p>These artefacts became the skeleton of my wireframes.</p>

            </header>

            <p>I began sketching wireframes at a fairly high level (showing basic ideas for forms, icons, pages, and menus) before transitioning to dummying pages in Figma.</p>

            <p>As I began to build out wireframes, the project ballooned with the creation of dozens of eventually discarded pages. Exact steps in processes turned out to be hard to pin down, and as I made changes in one place, it became difficult to maintain consistency.</p>

            <p>This taught me to start with atomic components before building out pages. I should have paid more attention to the smaller details first, built repeatable pieces, and then moved on to full screens and higher level processes.</p>

                </p>
              </header>

              <p>I worked out many of the problems in the static screens, and began to compose a clickable prototype. This turned out to be one of the hardest and most demanding sections of my work. I ended up making hundreds of pages of material while running into previously unknown constraints in Figma.</p>

              <p>I eventually dropped many responses to user input (such as hover states in menus), and leaving the prototype less interactive than planned in order to achieve functionality. This also meant losing hover-over-text which told users what clickable icons did.</p>

              <p>I continued to replace individual pieces with components and struggled to standardize my screens.</p>

              <p>I also started with a large set of screens for my desktop version (1440px width), and had to work backwards to make each desktop page responsive and to size things down for mobile screens.</p>

              <p>The order was backwards here. In the future, I intend to start with the smallest breakpoints (beginning in mobile) and to build from there.</p>

                <p>Alex learned how the system worked, successfully completing each task, and was able to apply the same approach to similar tasks, but was not always satisfied with the methods. She didn’t seem to enjoy the experience much; this might have been general discomfort with testing, but it was not helped in moments where she wasn’t sure how to accomplish tasks. In particular, the overflow menu was problematic and the ‘new’/plus menu was not immediately obvious to her.</p>

                <p>Emma had no comments or questions regarding the app. There were a number of pain points which left her unsure and made it difficult to move confidently through jot &. Without a ‘next’ button on tour pages, she wasn’t sure how to proceed. The connection between ‘upload’ and saving a file to the cloud was unclear to her, so uploading files took her a little while. Using the overflow menu to delete or move objects was not obvious to her–she wanted to click on items and have the relevant options appear. Similar issues persisted in the notepad. The program was basically broken for her.</p>

                <p>The testers were able to navigate the landing page and sign up easily. However, the onboarding tour and empty state screen posed problems. Alleviating fear was the most important thing I had to do after testing.</p>

                <p>Improved tour directions and the addition of buttons to advance the tour let users ease in to the experience.</p>

                <p>Although I had assumed older users would be more comfortable using a traditional drop-down menu system, this was not true. Instead, all testers found the overflow menu confusing. They wanted the actions which affected an item to be accessed by pressing the item itself, not in the overflow menu. I followed their guidance. This helped diminish user fear and streamlined the process of acting on files and folders.</p>

                <p>Testers wanted more of an indication of when they were in a note and where the note workspace was. So I emboldened the bread crumbs and added a transition animation between storage and notes before moving on to visual design.</p>

            <p>Based on the needs of our personas and users in general, jot &amp's primary values are creativity, communication, and dependability. Its promotional copy seeks a sense of togetherness, sharing, memories, fun, and ease, while leaving room for business and work. There is also a quiet emphasis on personal empowerment, as well as ‘saving’, since people want to save space on their devices by saving items to the cloud while saving money.</p>

            <p>The brand color, a bright violet, mixes of work and play. The brand copy of Poppins sets a jaunty, bold feel, while Open Sans assures professionalism and reliability as a  body copy. The logo brings all of this together in a playful, geometric combination of the brand name, a camera, and a stylus.</p>

            <p>With the branding set, I began to apply it to create a mockup from my wireframes in Figma.</p>

            <p>First, I found free images which matched the brand, illustrated them in Autodesk Sketchbook (iOS), simplified the images in Adobe Illustrator, and added them to the landing and features pages.</p>

            <p>Throughout the mockup, I simplified pages, reset type, and added color while increasing consistency and whitespace. My intent was to create a more straightforward experience.</p>

              <p>While working on my mockup, I was also building out connections between pages and components for the Figma prototype. I tested its features during this process when I made changes, and again before starting user testing. There weren’t any big surprises this time, just minor bugs. I fixed the problems before moving on to testing.
